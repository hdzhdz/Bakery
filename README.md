Bakery Database Management Website

-	The web will have 3 types of users: Admin, Baker and Clerk. 

-	When a baker login, they can pull up recipe for a specific goods that they have to make with a specific amount of ingredient. Once they are made, the baker can submit the amount and the database will update the item storage and reduce the ingredient storage.

-	When a clerk login, they will have a check out page where they can create order and add new customer ID if the customer wants to join and get “perks” of being a member. Once the order is checked, the database will update the amount of item storage have and save the order and order details.

-	For admin, they can see much more:

      -	Employees: How much the employee have done  (selling how many items, items made/sold), can edit account, password and other employee detail.
  
      -	Supplier, ingredients and recipe: Can add/ remove supplier and the ingredients are being supplied by it. Can created/update recipe with a list of ingredients amount and an instruction.
  
      -	Profit: Can see how much they earn by day, week, months, all time or can see separately sold/ expired, employees’ salary, and cost of ingredients/expired.
